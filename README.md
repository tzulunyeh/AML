# AML - Advanced Machine Learning

This repository contains hands-on exercises from an Advanced Machine Learning course, covering key areas in modern ML.

## Quick Overview

This repo demonstrates practical implementations across the following domains:

- **Statistical Foundations** - Standard deviation analysis, boxplot visualization
- **Clustering & Anomaly Detection** - DBScan clustering, Isolation Forest, Robust Random Cut Forest
- **Deep Generative Models** - AutoEncoders (AE), Variational AutoEncoders (VAE), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
- **Explainable AI** - Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE), Shapley Values, LIME
- **Reinforcement Learning** - Q-Table learning, Frozen Lake game implementation

Each exercise includes complete implementations with visualizations and analysis.
